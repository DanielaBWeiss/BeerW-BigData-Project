'''
Creating the first version of the data we will be working with
This is the entrypoint to using our data in this first version. 
We remove unwanted columns and choose a single city to be our focal point.
Any changes to the data that is common to all the groupmembers, 
will be contained in a notebook and will contain the steps necessary to replicate the data to work with.Â¶
