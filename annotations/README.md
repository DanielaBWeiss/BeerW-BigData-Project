# Annotations

These are our very own annotated entries:
1. *Guest Count annotations*:
    Since the `guest_count` feature values cannot always be trusted (as not all bars fill in this feature properly), a manual annotation was used in order to get a good grasp of this feature (the values of 0/1 are most likely to be falsy).
2. *Occasions Annotations*:
    For each bin of `guest_count`, an annotation of several tables has been applied for the different occasions.
